<p><strong> Dates: 7/7/17 - July 17th to July 21st<br> GALLERY PARTY: Wednesday July 19th /// 7-11pm</strong> <br><br> The Lower East Side and New York City has always had an exciting history with screen printing. More than just Andy Warhol's famous vibrant color portraits of celebrities and political figures, screen prints were also countless band flyers, T-shirts, posters and even record album covers, whatever those are. Harken back to a not so distant past with this group show at the Con Artist Collective and relive a time when this mostly American art form and DIY aesthetic was a familiar element on street light poles, alley walls, underground magazines and music club venues.<br><br> 7 七, QĪ- LUCKY/UNLUCKY<br> Like 5, 7 has both positive and negative connotations in Chinese culture. For the positive side, 七 sounds like both 起 (qǐ), which means “start” or “rise”, and also 气 (qì), which means “vital energy”. Seven is also seen as a lucky number for relationships. The Qixi Festival (七夕節), also known as the Chinese Valentine's Day, falls on the 7th day of the 7th month in the lunar calendar. The 7th month is also known as the “ghost month” in China, where ghosts and spirits are believed to rise from hell to visit earth. While ghosts may be seen as omens, the ghost festival in the 7th month is widely celebrated. 7 may also be considered unlucky because 七 sounds like 欺 , meaning “cheat”.<br><br> Flyer by <a href="http://www.idlebeats.com/screen-prints" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Idle Beats Shanghai</a></p>

<p><strong> ON VIEW April 29th to April 30th</strong><br><br> Eddie is a Multi-media artist, specializing in Illustrations combined with electronic components, performance, installations and Street Art. His work focus on Interaction, both culturally and socially utilizing humor and social commentary to create entertaining and engaging artworks that bas been exhibited successfully Internationally at Art fairs and Art Biennales. This follows numerous successful solo shows in Australia. He always seeks new ventures and experimenting with new media and collaborating with others, and implementing larger of projects public art.<br><br> His work is often site specific, and often involve viewer participation with performances occurring from time to time. He wants to break the stigma of art being separate from us and our everyday lives, make it accessible and easy to grasp by the average person. <br><br> With his first ever American exhibition, Eddie used found media clippings from a previous trip to New York in 2016, and drew people from thousands of photos he took around the city. His work is ultimately aimed at entertaining but also stimulating dialogue and debate on some more serious issues. The works has a mixed media approach to them, where the media collages and backgrounds, replicate the everyday urban environment, and the drawn foreground, symbolising our everyday lives as we navigate life. Anti- Consumerism, sexism, religion and nature all plays part in the Allegorical works that Eddie draws as he studies cultures and social behavior where ever he goes.</p>

As an artist, I challenge myself to approach creating work in the same fashion. I use the process of discovery to evolve my technique each time I place paint to canvas while still remaining focused on my primary style of employing texture and color.<br> In this show, you will find 7 new pieces that I have worked on over the past 2 years after a study in color theory. I am excited by how colors react, foregrounds and backgrounds clash and combine, and how texture creates depth and shadows affecting both color and mood.<br><br>I invite guests to really interact with the art in a sensory way—get close—touch it to experience the juxtaposition of textures and color to see how the differences in colors changes your experience."</p>

<p><strong>ONE NIGHT ONLY!<br>Wednesday, March 22nd /// 7-11 PM <br>Artwork on view March 22nd through March 24th 11am to 7pm</strong> <br><br> “I grew up thinking art was pictures until I got into music and found I was an artist and didn’t paint” - Chuck Berry<br><br> We have decided to reschedule “The Red Hats” Trump-centric group show until April and pay our respects to the recent passing of artist and musician Chuck Berry with a party. Con Artist Collective presents a one night only interactive art exhibit dedicated to the legacy and music Chuck Berry. Visitors are welcome to use our lightbox trace and pin their own drawing of Chuck to the wall. We will be hosting a silent auction of these drawings that night to raise money for local arts education charities. As funding gets cut for arts and music education, it’s up to all of us to keep non-profits dedicated to arts and music education alive! Come Wednesday, make some art, and dance with us.<br><br> <strong>Con Artist Collective &amp; Gallery</strong><br>119 Ludlow St. New York, New York 10002<br>Open Monday through Saturday 11am to 7pm</p>
