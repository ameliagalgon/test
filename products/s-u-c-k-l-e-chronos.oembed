The slow ticking of years. Like sand thru the hourglass, these are the days of our lives. Yes my friends, no Villain need be, Time is the enemy. This guy, however, doesn't work on that big-picture, epic, life-spanning level. He wishes he were that heavy. Nah this guy fucks you up on some petty, day-to-day  shit. Missed your Subway by 15 seconds? He did that. Did your computer crash before you saved and you had to re-do an hour of work? That's him. Did you double-book clients and they were both late? Say Hello to this fucking guy. A master of dumb mistakes, bad timing, and chronic lateness, CHRONOS is hated by all Villains under the sun. Untouchable, unbeatable, and totally irrational, this immortal fuck face will suck away your life force second by second, turning your hard-won optimism to despair and frustration. Striking at random and without warning, he will tax you every day that you live. There is no balm or protection against his constant, unrelenting attack. Just accept it and keep learning new curse words. You are gonna need them...\"\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Con Artist","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":40202605765,"sku":"","price":5.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0123\/0942\/products\/Sucklord_Chronos_store.jpg?v=1503083115","url":"https:\/\/conartistnyc.com\/products\/s-u-c-k-l-e-chronos","provider":"Con Artist","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
