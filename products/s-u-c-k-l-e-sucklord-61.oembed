Who? This can't be the SUCKLORD we know and fear, can it? What's wrong with him? Why is he helping people? Did he take too many drugs? Did he get hit on the head? What happened to all that fly VILLAINY we've come to expect? And why did the number go down? Is this some past version of the SUCKLORD before he turned to evil? I thought he was born that way. Who is this corny do-godder? This isn't what I signed up for. What? What's that you say? It's a mistake ? You were just kidding? *PHEW* You really had me worried there for a second....\"\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Con Artist","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":40198904261,"sku":"","price":5.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0123\/0942\/products\/Sucklord_sucklord61_store.jpg?v=1503080490","url":"https:\/\/conartistnyc.com\/products\/s-u-c-k-l-e-sucklord-61","provider":"Con Artist","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
